eg:mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -uroot -p123
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root --port=3308

# MySQL optimization principle.
The MySQL logical architecture is divided into three layers, the top layer is the client layer, such as connection processing, authorization authentication, security and other functions are handled at this layer.
Most of MySQL's core services are in the middle layer, including query, parsing, parsing, analysis, optimization, caching, built-in functions (time, math, encryption, etc.). All the functionality across the storage engine is also implemented at this layer: stored procedures, triggers, views, etc.
The lowest layer is the storage engine, which is responsible for data storage and extraction in MySQL. The intermediate service layer communicates with the storage engine through APIs, which mask the differences between different storage engines.
